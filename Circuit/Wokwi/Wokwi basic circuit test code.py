# Basic circuit plan for the peili project: On/Off switch, buzzer, signal led, servo motor and Pi Pico W with test code
# Wokwi link: https://wokwi.com/projects/394594113656475649
# Code for playing music with buzzer is from https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/buzzer-music-raspberry-pi-pico
# Example code is for 180 degree servo, you need different code for continous rotation servo
# https://github.com/TTitanUA/micropython_servo_pdm_360 might work
# TODO: Check if the micro servo needs logic level shifter to work (5V->3.3V)
# Resistor on buzzer might not be necessary

#from picozero import Speaker #If using buzzer for just on/off sound
from machine import Pin, PWM # Pins, PWM control for buzzer
from picozero import Servo  # importing Servo class to  control the servo motor
from time import sleep

# creating a Speaker, led and servo object
buzzer = PWM(Pin(1))
#speaker = Speaker(1)
led = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
servo = Servo(15)
switch = Pin(28, Pin.IN)

# Dictionary for matching tones with frequency
